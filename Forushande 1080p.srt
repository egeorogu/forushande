Where's Hossein?

27
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900

Don't bring too much bric-a-brac with you

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,020
Our house has everything

47
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay

48
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,580
I can't find it

49
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,380

You were supposed to just bring a towel and toothbrush

55
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,020
It has my towel and toothbrush in it

56
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,260
Have you locked it?

57
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,460
Yep

58
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,460
Keys, keys!

Hey Kati

64
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,740
You're alive!

65
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,420
When Sia said the house had collapsed, I thought we'd have to drag you from the rubble

66
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,300
Oh jeez... what's going on here?

67
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,940
It smells of gas...

68
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,300
It's from last night

69
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,220
Let's get out of quickly here then

70
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,340
Hey

71
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,340
Why have you come up?

72
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,380
Cut off the electricity - this is dripping

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,300
I still can't find the card

74
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,340
Is it not under your paperwork?

75
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,500
Don't go there Kati, it's dangerous

76
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,900
Oh my God...

77
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,860
<i>You could only hear the sobbing of Mashti Hassan's wife, sitting alone with a lantern on the stable roof</i>

78
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,180
<i>and the moans of a cow that had been left behind</i>

79
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,260
Sir! Is it a true story?

80
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:57,940
True? No, but it's argued that Sa'edi's characters and relationships contain a lot of truth

81
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,500
Sir, how can someone turn into a cow?

82
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,380
Try looking in the mirror?

83
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,580
Good one...

84
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,300
Seriously though Sir, how does a person become a cow?

85
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,100
Slowly...

86
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,740
Sir, are we watching the film of this story?

87
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,500
Good idea. I might bring it next time and we can watch it together.

88
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,420
Yes?

89
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,180
Sir, when can we watch your play?

90
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,940

Joking aside, have any of you read it?

98
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,340
