The building is collapsing!

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:39,820
Come on! Come on!

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,140
Are you coming?

20
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,500
Mr Emad! For the love of God, someone come and help me with this kid.

Aren't you coming? I'll come with you too

24
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,020
No no, you go and wait outside

25
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,980
Tell everyone to wait outside

26
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,900
Where's Hossein?

27
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
I can't bring the kids down by myself

28
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Hossein?

29
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:09,940

Get up Hossein

35
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,460
Go and wait in the alley

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,620
Come on Hossein

39
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,140
What are they doing?!

40
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,660

Guys!

45
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,860
Don't bring too much bric-a-brac with you

46
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,020
Our house has everything

47
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay

48
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,580
I can't find it

49
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,380
I don't know, keep looking

50
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,580
Should I take it?

51

52
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,300
Thanks
Should I take it?

53
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,580
You were supposed to just bring a towel and toothbrush
Thanks

54
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,140
You were supposed to just bring a towel and toothbrush

55
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,020
It has my towel and toothbrush in it

56
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,260
Have you locked it?

57
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,460
Yep

58
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,460
Keys, keys!

59
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,860
Excuse me

60
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,100
Guys?

61
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,140
Hey

62
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,220
Hey Kati
Hey

63
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,140
Hey Kati

64
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,740
You're alive!

65
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,420
When Sia said the house had collapsed, I thought we'd have to drag you from the rubble

66
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,300
Oh jeez... what's going on here?

67
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,940
It smells of gas...

68
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,300
It's from last night

69
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,220
Let's get out of quickly here then

70
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,340
Hey

71
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,340
Why have you come up?

72
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,380
Cut off the electricity - this is dripping

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,300
I still can't find the card

74
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,340
Is it not under your paperwork?

75
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,500
Don't go there Kati, it's dangerous

76
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,900
Oh my God...

77
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,860
<i>You could only hear the sobbing of Mashti Hassan's wife, sitting alone with a lantern on the stable roof</i>

78
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,180
<i>and the moans of a cow that had been left behind</i>

79
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,260
Sir! Is it a true story?

80
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:57,940
True? No, but it's argued that Sa'edi's characters and relationships contain a lot of truth

81
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,500
Sir, how can someone turn into a cow?

82
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,380
Try looking in the mirror?
